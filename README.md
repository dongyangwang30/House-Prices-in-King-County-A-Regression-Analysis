# House-Prices-in-King-County-A-Regression-Analysis

This project is the final team project for Stat 504: Applied Regression. We studied the housing prices in King County, WA by regression methods.

We performed EDA for 20,000 observations with cleaning, transformation, visualizations, and Pearsonâ€™s correlation table. We then modeled with stepwise OLS Regression on the logarithm of house prices, and introduced quadratic and interaction terms. After that, we used Quantile Regression and regressed over three regions in King County. Finally, we identified predictors that are consistent throughout quantiles of house prices and across regions in King County.

The dataset has been made available by Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction/version/1.
